        <p>Drillcom was founded in 2010, in the middle of a typical cold Finnish winter, right in the heart of Nokias' industrial area. The founding  triplet you find at the center of our firm, have accumulated a rock hard multidisciplinary expertise during their 50 years of work history in industries such as design, engineering, machining, electrics and logistics, for a total experience of more than 50 years. With this diverse talent pool, Drillcom was established, very successfully in our own opinion.</p>
        <p>Our first workhorse, RD 22, was designed and manufactured during our first year in business and was delivered for test use to our first customer, to a domestic stone quarry. To this very day, it can still be found hard at work. The design philosophy behind our pilot machine was to develop a working solution, with a simple functioning principle, that is reliable and energy efficient, with the target on saving the drilling equipment from wear and tear. This line of machine's development has been continuous and on the cutting edge of our field.</p>
        <p>Due to the continuous upward trend in our sales and repair operations, the production facilities have become small one after the other and there has been more than one relocation over the years. The underlying idea of acquiring larger facilities has been to enable us  to do maintenance on bigger mining equipment from other manufacturers. These include drilling rigs, excavators and transportation equipment, basically anything and everything that has to do with mining. Being a full service shop, we take pride in servicing all kinds of machines, in the field and at our workshop. For that reason, a significant positive factor in our revenue stream is the maintenance work we do, which at its best consist of 140 full maintenance years.</p>
        <p>From modest begginings, our company has expanded from the mere manufacturing of rock drills to comprehensive applied extraction equipment assemblies, which are used by our customer base in a multitude of applications which vary vastly covering all from below to over ground extraction techniques. Diamond wiresaws are also found in its own product line, that of which we have shipped all over the world.</p>
        <p>100% of the parts used, are supplied by local subcontractors or made in house out of Finnish made raw materials. Our customer base extends to more than 20 countries and our distribution network grows year by year.</p>
